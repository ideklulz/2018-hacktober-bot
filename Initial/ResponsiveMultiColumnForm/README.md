Our solution to allow new users to port their phone numbers from a different carrier to the "uncarrier", T-Mobile!
The usual method was to go to the store and wait for a few hours until the t-mobile expert has verified this information.
The New solution lets you do it on the go with only a web page. and its bery simple 
all the user needs to do is enter some basic information about themselves that is asked usually at the shop like name, date of birth, email etc.
Then the page asks for a couple copies of address proofs and one indentity verification like a passport or driving licence.
Now, we will be using TensorFlow's extensive library to hash out whether the identity proof matches the specifications provided by official agencies and we can easily use OCR to obtain and verify the necessary information.


After all of that, the form has a built in terms and conditions scrollable since extremely sensitive information is being exchanged.


Once the user hits submit, a pop up appears saying that an email will be sent with confirmation and link to next step of he form.
the form will be sent to T-Mobile and then processed.
A representative will contact "The Blue Company", and confirm the porting and cancel your account with them.
No hassel for the user.


Now, we realize that T-Mobile has a better interface for porting from another carrier but it redirects you to a phone number which you need to call and get things sorted.
Now that's exactly what we are trying to get rid of.



Users of t-mobile are people who have busy lives and busy people need things done fast.
Usually when porting you need to go to the store wait for a few hours until information is processed, and its very time consuming for the clients and not as efficient as it could be.
This application could be used even to collect the data of all the clients at the store and leave satisfied with a very simple and non time consuming solution.
