PREVIOUS ACCOUNT INFORMATION:
This is where the next step comes in.
Now, the user will be sent an email or a text message on their current number which will allow them to access the next page after T-Mobile successfully confirms that an acccount can be created.
The next page will allow users to put in their security information and once their application is sent to T-Mobile the SIM card will be then sent to the clients doorstep with minimal effort.

This page contains a click on link on the plans which allow the users to look at T-Mobile's offers with more detail.
We are confident this setup will keep customers happy and will make the experience satisfing and informative.
